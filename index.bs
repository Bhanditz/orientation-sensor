Introduction {#intro}
============

The OrientationSensor API extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
to provide information that describes the device's physical orientation.

The base object describes the orientation in relation to <a>Earth's reference
coordinate system</a>, thus in a stationary three dimensional Cartesian
coordinate system.

Inheriting objects can describe the orientation in relation to other stationary
directions, such as true north, or even non stationary directions, like in
relation to a devices own z-position, drifting towards its latest most stable
z-position.

The data provided by the OrientationSensor API are similar to data from [=deviceorientation Event=], but the OrientationSensor
API has some significant differences:
1. The OrientationSensor API represents orientation data in WebGL-compatible formats (quaternion, rotation matrix).
1. The OrientationSensor API satisfies stricter latency requirements.
1. Unlike [=deviceorientation Event=] the OrientationSensor API explicitly defines which [=low-level=] motion sensors are used
   to obtain the orientation data, thus obviating possible interoperability issues.
1. An {{OrientationSensor}} instance is configurable via {{SensorOptions}} constructor parameter.

Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="js">
    const sensor = new OrientationSensor();
    const mat4 = new Float32Array(16);
    sensor.start();
    
    sensor.onchange = () => {
      sensor.populateMatrix(mat4);
    };

    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    </pre>
</div>

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

There are no specific security and privacy considerations
beyond those described in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The orientation sensors's associated {{Sensor}} subclass is the {{OrientationSensor}} class.

The orientation sensor is a [=high-level=] sensor which is created through [=sensor-fusion=]
of the [=low-level=] motion sensors:

 - accelerometer that measures [=acceleration=],
 - gyroscope that measures [=angular velocity=], and
 - magnetometer that measures [=magnetic field=].

Note: Corresponding [=low-level=] sensors are defined in [[ACCELEROMETER]], [[GYROSCOPE]], and
[[MAGNETOMETER]]. Regardless, the fusion is platform specific and can happen in software or
hardware, i.e. on a sensor hub.

A [=latest reading=] per [=sensor=] of orientation type includes an [=map/entry=]
whose [=map/key=] is "quaternion" and whose [=map/value=] contains a four element [=list=].
The elements of the [=list=] are equal to components of a unit quaternion [[QUATERNIONS]]
[cos(θ/2), V<sub>x</sub> * sin(θ/2), V<sub>y</sub> * sin(θ/2), V<sub>z</sub> * sin(θ/2)] where V is the unit vector representing
the axis of rotation. The quaternion represents rotation of a device hosting motion sensors in relation to a <dfn>Earth's reference coordinate system</dfn> defined as a three
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), where:

 - x-axis is a vector product of y.z that is tangential to the ground and points east.
 - y-axis is tangential to the ground and points towards magnetic north.
 - z-axis points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the plane made up of x and y axes.

The device's <a>local coordinate system</a> is the same as defined by [=low-level=] motion sensors.

Note: Figure below represents the case where device's <a>local coordinate system</a> and <a>Earth's reference coordinate system</a> are aligned, therefore,
orientation sensor's [=latest reading=] would represent 0 (rad) [[SI]] rotation about each axis.

API {#api}

The OrientationSensor Interface {#orientationsensor-interface}
-------------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions sensorOptions)]
  interface OrientationSensor : Sensor {
    void populateQuaternion(Float32Array targetBuffer);
    void populateMatrix(Float32Array targetBuffer);
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct a OrientationSensor Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke the
<a>construct a Sensor object</a> abstract operation.

### OrientationSensor.populateQuaternion() ### {#orientationsensor-populatequaternion}

<div algorithm="to populate quaternion">
The {{OrientationSensor/populateQuaternion()}} method must run these steps or their [=equivalent=]:
    1.  If |targetBuffer| is not of type {{Float32Array}}, [=throw=] a
        "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  If |targetBuffer| is of type {{Float32Array}} with a size less than four, [=throw=] a
        "{{TypeError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  If the value of |sensor_instance|.[=[[state]]=] is not <a enum-value>"activated"</a>,
        [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  Run these sub-steps:
        1.  Let |quaternion| be the value of [=latest reading=]["quaternion"]
        1.  If |quaternion| is `null`, abort these steps.
        1.  Copy |quaternion| into |targetBuffer|
</div>

### OrientationSensor.populateMatrix() ### {#orientationsensor-populatematrix}

The {{OrientationSensor/populateMatrix()}} method  populates the given buffer with WebGL-compatible rotation matrix
which is converted from the value of [=latest reading=]["quaternion"] [[QUATCONV]], as shown below

<img src="quaternion_to_rotation_matrix.png" style="display: block;margin: auto;" alt="Converting quaternion to rotation matrix." width="50%" height="50%">

where:

 - W = cos(θ/2).
 - X = V<sub>x</sub> * sin(θ/2).
 - Y = V<sub>y</sub> * sin(θ/2).
 - Z = V<sub>z</sub> * sin(θ/2).

The rotation matrix is flattened in |targetBuffer| according to the column-major order.

<div algorithm="to populate WebGL-compatible matrix">
The {{OrientationSensor/populateMatrix()}} method must run these steps or their [=equivalent=]:
    1.  If |targetBuffer| is not of type {{Float32Array}}, [=throw=] a
        "{{SyntaxError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  If |targetBuffer| is of type {{Float32Array}} with a size less than sixteen, [=throw=] a
        "{{TypeError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  If the value of |sensor_instance|.[=[[state]]=] is not <a enum-value>"activated"</a>,
        [=throw=] an "{{InvalidStateError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
    1.  Run these sub-steps:
        1.  Let |quaternion| be the value of [=latest reading=]["quaternion"]
        1.  If |quaternion| is `null`, abort these steps.
        1.  Let |w| be the value of |quaternion|[0].
        1.  Let |x| be the value of |quaternion|[1].
        1.  Let |y| be the value of |quaternion|[2].
        1.  Let |z| be the value of |quaternion|[3].
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[0] = 1 - 2 * y * y - 2 * z * z.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[1] = 2 * x * y - 2 * z * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[2] = 2 * x * z + 2 * y * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[4] = 2 * x * y + 2 * z * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[5] = 1 - 2 * x * x - 2 * z * z.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[6] = 2 * y * z - 2 * x * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[8] = 2 * x * z - 2 * y * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[9] = 2 * y * z + 2 * x * w.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[10] = 1 - 2 * x * x - 2 * y * y.
        1.  Set |targetBuffer|[15] = 1.

Use-Cases and Requirements {#usecases-requirements}
==========================

Use cases {#usecases}
---------

    1. A compass monitor's the device's orientation relative to true north and aligns the compass heading in a three-dimensional space.
    1. A game uses the device's orientation relative to the ground as user input. For example, a ball-in-a-maze puzzle.
    1. A WebVR polyfill tracks the headset's (or mobile device's for mobile VR) orientation.
    1. A map application adjusts a two-dimensional map such that the device shows the map relative to the actual surroundings.

Functional requirements {#functional-requirements}
-----------------------

    1. The API must provide data that describes the device's physical orientation in a stationary 3D coordinate system.
    1. The API must provide data in representation that matches that of the WebGL interfaces and methods.
    1. The API must address the VR requirements for high performance and low motion-to-photon latency, and not
       introduce significant overhead over corresponding native platform APIs.
    1. The API must extend Generic Sensor and inherit its functionality and satisfy its requirements.

Non-functional requirements {#nonfunctional-requirements}
---------------------------

    1. The API must provide developer friendly and consistent higher level abstractions optimised for the common use cases.
